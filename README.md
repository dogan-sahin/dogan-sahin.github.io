# Personal Website
This is my first web development project from scratch to learn the basics of web development, which includes HTML, CSS, JS and responsive webdesign.

It is used as my portfolio website to display my skills, projects and other personal information.

You can visit the page at [dokksen.github.io](https://dokksen.github.io/).



**If you like my website you can fork this repository and edit the html files for you own preferences by adding your personal details.**
